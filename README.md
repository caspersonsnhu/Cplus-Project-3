# Cplus-Project-3

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
A grocery store needed a program that showed how many produce items were being purchased to have the most effective layout in their store. They have a txt file that shows how many items were purchased. I aimed to read the txt file and give them multiple options to show how many times each item was purchased. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I did really well creating the menu and prompting the user for an input. I have done this a few times and am getting more confident each time. I did this part really well.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the code by making the menu and input from the user in a different class/file. I could use this file for other projects. This will make my code more efficient because I will not have to create the same code repeatedly. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found backing up the data to a frequency.dat file challenging. I didn't know where to put the code to backup the data. I tried it at the beginning, and it didn't work. So, I moved it to the bottom, and that worked great. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Pulling data from other files, reading that data, and spitting something out to the end user is extremely important. Many projects require this skill. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this code maintainable, readable, and adaptable by putting in line comments, organization of my code, and correct naming. Doing these things makes it easy to follow my code and make improvements/changes if necessary.
